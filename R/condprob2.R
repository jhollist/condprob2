#' Conditional probability analysis in R
#' 
#' This package provides a series of functions for running a conditional 
#' probability analysis.  This method was originally developed as a way to 
#' examine probability of impairment of an ecological resource (e.g. streams 
#' or lakes) given a stressor amount. The primary purpose of this package is to
#' serve as a replacement to the deprecated software described in (Hollister et
#' al. 2008).
